          The Great Rift

      <div>
        I am sure you remember the screams. Three years ago, reality itself was torn by the Great Rift. Though I advise you not to gaze upon it for long, the
        evidence is written across our skies; a vast Warp-storm, a wound in reality through which daemons can walk.
        No longer can I shield you from the truth: daemons exist, their vile forces assail us daily, and it is now your duty to fight against them. I
        fear my prayers will be of little aid against this enemy, so I will tell you all I can of the Warp.

          The Warp
        </b1>
      </div>
      <div>
        You have been educated little on the nightmare Immaterium; ignorance was once our best defence from the unholy realm known as the Warp, but
        now it stands at our doorstep. I can tell you but a few details, and the less said or thought of it the better.
        The Warp is another reality, a realm of daemons that want nothing more than to corrupt and destroy. Their influence is responsible for
        every evil act; weakness of the soul feeds the Warp, and every sin births a new daemon. These foul creatures entice the good and pious with offers of
        power and privilege, preying on Humansâ€™ weak hearts to corrupt more to their blasphemous cause. And so their power grows.
        You must be ever-vigilant for the taint of Warp. Its agents are not merely monstrous daemons, but Humans marked by their mutated
        flesh and twisted minds. May your faith in the God-Emperor be your shield against them.

          The Gilead System
        </b1>

      <div>
        In short, Gilead is on the surface a self-sufficient system. The Rift has caused much disorder in your time, and its most recently
        calamitous storm has completely isolated the Gilead System from the rest of the galaxy. While many have attempted to pass through the storm,
        none have returned, and are feared to be eternally lost in the warp storm. Such fates have discouraged many from the thought of leaving Gilead and have in many ways forced the
        inhabitants of Gilead to come to grips with a reality: Gilead is now their new home. Whether for better or worse, those in Gilead make their stand against the forces of chaos alone.
        What dark plans do the servants of chaos have for the inhabitants of your system? Isolated and alone, can you survive against the terrors of the Immaterium?
